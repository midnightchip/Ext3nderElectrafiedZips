To use any of these scripts, you need to unzip the folder onto /
To install unzip folder onto / cd /<folder> chmod +x ./install.sh ./install.sh
Dont change the folder names, as they are important, and need to stay the same.
The Ext3nderRC.zip is for RC versions of Electra, The Ext3nderElectrified is for electra b11(it may work on others, but I only had 
b11-3 on hand).If you are having error 81, revoke the certificates, try removing the provision profiles, and if all else fails install it again. 
You may need to run uicache after installing and respringing wouldn't hurt.
I'm not liable for any damage you do to your device, just fyi.
